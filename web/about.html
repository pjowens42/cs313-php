            Hello, my name is Paul Owens.<br> I am a junior at 
            BYU-I studying Software Engineering.<br> I am from Pocatello, ID,
             but most of my family now lives in Grand Rapids, Michigan.<br> Some 
             of my hobbies include gaming, baking/cooking, watching movies, and
              going on walks with my lovely wife.<br> I married my wife, my best friend,
               on June 10, 2017. It’s almost been two years!<br><br> I’ve featured one of my 
               favorite pictures of the two of us on our wedding day.</p>
